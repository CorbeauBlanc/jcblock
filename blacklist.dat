# The first field is the one tested. It can be the telephone
# number or some other field in the caller ID string. It *must
# be* terminated with a '?' character. The Date-of-last-block
# field starts in the 20th column. Be sure to replace the
# '------' (shown in the examples below) with the current date
# in format MMDDYY so that room to store the date is present
# on the line. Or you may enter '++++++' if you want the entry
# to stay on the list permanently. The rest of the line (out
# to 80 chars) can contain a comment of your choosing.
# ******Do not use tabs in the entries!*********
#
# Examples (without the initial '#' chars!):
#Tested field:     Date field:   Comment field:
#8005551212?        ------         JUNK CALL
#Cell Phone?        ------         (A cell phone call)
#                  | <---- the 20th column
